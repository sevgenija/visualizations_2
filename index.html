  <h4>Potential side-effects from chemotherapy.</h4>


  <p>People like you experience problems from chemotherapy, which have a big impact on their lifestyles.</p>
  <p>Chemotherapy kills fast-growing cancer cells. But when the drugs travel throughout
  the body they affect healthy cells as well. The side effects related to chemotherapy
  are caused by the damage of these healthy cells. The side effects can vary,
  depending on the drug or combination of them. However, the most common ones people
  in the same risk group as yours might experience are listed here.</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Nausea/vomiting. </strong> When chemotherapy drugs enter the body, your
  digestive system try to get rid of them. Sometimes accute nausea and vomiting can be
  experienced on the day of chemotherapy and sometimes several days after.
  You would get the medicines to prevent vomiting but sometimes they fail. Refractory vomiting is when
  the medicamentations are given to you to prevent vomiting and nausea but they appear to not work.
  This means that your nausea and vomiting have become refractory or no longer respond to the drugs you’re getting to prevent it.
  Refractory vomiting may be caused after a few or even several chemotherapy treatments. </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Diarrhea.</strong> Diarrhea is the common side effect of chemotherapy. The
  Abdominal cramping is an early sign that diarrhea is complicated and needs aggressive treatment.
  Diahrrea leads to dehydration, which might cause hospitalization.
  The severity of diahrrea might vary and in some cases raise up to 6 stools per day.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Appetite loss. </strong> Chemotherapy may affect your eating habbits
  and cause appetite loss. This can lead to weight loss and depression. Other
  things, such as trouble swallowing, pain, nausea, or vomiting can
  decrease your appetite as well.  </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Insomnia.</strong> Sleep problems such as being unable to fall asleep and/or stay asleep,
  also called insomnia, are common in your risk group. Long-term insomnia might also
  cause depression and icrease anxiety.</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Fatigue. </strong> The cancer related fatigue is different from the fatigue
  in daily life. It can be described as feeling weak, listless, drained, or “washed out.”
  Some people even feel tired to eat or go to the bathroom. Rest or sleep might not help and
  any type of activity can be exhausting. You may feel week and low on energy and can't
  concentrate or focus on things. This may also affect your work or social life. Most often
  cancer related fatigue is provoked by anemia (low blood cell count), which is caused by
  chemotherapy and cancer itself. If chemotherapy is given in cycles, fatigue will get worse
  towards the later cycles.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some side effects disappear quite quickly, but for some of them it can take months
  or years to disappear completely. While side effects can be unpleasant, they must
  be accessed against the need to kill the cancer cells. The visualizations below might
  help you to imagine how many people in the same risk group experience these particular
  side effects. You can interact with the visualizations and receive information in different
  formats.</p>

<h4>Icon pictograph</h4>
<p>Imagine that there are 100 people and some of them experience different side
  effects from chemotherapy. This pictogram allows you to see how many people out of 100
  from your risk group experience different side effects. If you want to decrease the amount of factors to be shown to you
or compare, for example, only two factors, press the checkboxes in the legend and disable them.</p>
